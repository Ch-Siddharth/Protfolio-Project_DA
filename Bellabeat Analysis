##### Installing Packages
```{r}
#Install Pakages

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

### Importing Data

Data is downloaded first then being imported from own Directory 

```{r}
daily_activity <- read_csv("Protfolio Projects/Bellabeat Analysis/Raw Data/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_calories <- read_csv("Protfolio Projects/Bellabeat Analysis/Raw Data/dailyCalories_merged.csv")
daily_intensities <- read_csv("Protfolio Projects/Bellabeat Analysis/Raw Data/dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
sleep <- read_csv("Protfolio Projects/Bellabeat Analysis/Raw Data/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read_csv("Protfolio Projects/Bellabeat Analysis/Raw Data/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```

* Let's Check the data using Head() function

```{r}
head(daily_activity)
```


#### fixing the formating for Date and Time datatype

```{r}
#daily_activity
daily_activity$ActivityDate=as.POSIXct(daily_activity$ActivityDate, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz=Sys.timezone())
daily_activity$date <- format(daily_activity$ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%y")
#daily_calories
daily_calories$ActivityDay=as.POSIXct(daily_calories$ActivityDay, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz=Sys.timezone())
daily_calories$Day <- format(daily_calories$ActivityDay, format = "%m/%d/%y")
#daily_intensities
daily_intensities$ActivityDay=as.POSIXct(daily_intensities$ActivityDay, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz=Sys.timezone())
daily_intensities$Day <- format(daily_intensities$ActivityDay, format = "%m/%d/%y")
#sleep
sleep$SleepDay=as.POSIXct(sleep$SleepDay, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
sleep$date <- format(sleep$SleepDay, format = "%m/%d/%y")
```



#### Now, Formating is done for data, let's Summarize the data

```{r}
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(daily_calories$Id)
n_distinct(daily_intensities$Id)
n_distinct(sleep$Id)
n_distinct(weight$Id)
```
Showing No. of Participants in each categories of data.

Let's keep continue and try to find more useful information from data (Data Summary)

```{r}
#daily_activity
daily_activity %>% 
  select(TotalSteps, TotalDistance, SedentaryMinutes, Calories) %>% 
  summary()
#Active Minutes in daily_activity dataset
daily_activity %>% 
  select(VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes) %>% 
  summary()
#daily_calorie
daily_calories %>% 
  select(Calories) %>% 
  summary()
#weight
weight %>%
  select(WeightKg, BMI) %>%
  summary()
#sleep
sleep %>%
  select(TotalSleepRecords, TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalTimeInBed) %>%
  summary()
```

### Key Findings from this summary-

* Major of the participants are lightly active
* AVg. Sedentary time is 991 min. which needs to be reduced
* Average total steps per day are 7638 which a little bit less for having health benefits. According to the CDC research, to lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes) by 51%, 8,000 steps per day should be taken and Taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps.

## Merging Data For Analysis

Inner joining of datasets daily_activity and Sleep on Id & Date.

```{r}
merged_data <- merge(sleep, daily_activity, by=c('Id', 'date'))
head(merged_data)
```

# Data Visualization

```{r}
#Showing trend between total Sleep and Total time in bed

ggplot(data = sleep) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed, color=Id)) + labs(title = "Total Sleep in min vs Total time in Bed")
```
* This trend shows linear relationship.

```{r}
#Total Steps vs Calory
ggplot(data = daily_activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories, color=Id)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "loess") + labs(title = "Total Steps Vs Calory")
```
* Positive Correlation Found i.e. More Steps we walk, more calories will burn.

```{r}
ggplot(data=merged_data, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=SedentaryMinutes)) + 
geom_point(color='darkgreen') + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Minutes A sleep vs. Sedentary Minutes")
```
* Negative Correlation found between Total minute a Sleep and Sedentary Minutes.
* To improve sleep, Sedentary Minutes must be reduced.


# Insights/Findings
  
* Average total steps per day are 7638 which a little bit less for having health benefits.Compony can encourage users to reach    atleast 8000 steps a day to stay fit through marketing campeign.

* If users want to improve their sleep, Bellabeat should consider using app notifications to go to bed.
* To improve sleep, Sedentary Minutes must be reduced.
* If users want to lose Fat, it’s probably a good idea to control daily calorie consumption to become healthy. Bellabeat can      suggest some ideas for low-calorie lunch and dinner.
